# EcoTask
EcoTask is a full-stack application that encourages sustainable behaviors through quick tasks (micro-actions) that users can perform in their daily lives.

The backend is built using Spring Boot with Kotlin, providing a robust and structured REST API, while the frontend is developed with React.js for a responsive and modern user interface.
